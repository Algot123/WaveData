# WaveData
This repository stores wave data from ocean waves collected by Prof. C.Swam and Dr. A. Callaghan at Imperial College London. 
It also includes codes provided by PhD student Parvathy Kunchi Kannan for calculating surface elevation based on Stokes' regular wave theory 
and a second order random wave theory proposed by Sharma and Dean.
